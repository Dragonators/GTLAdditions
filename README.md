## Introduction

In the later stages of developing our Minecraft tech modpack, we realized that the original mods' production capabilities were starting to fall short in the high-tech phase.  To address this, we began developing a custom, private mod. Initially, we envisioned simply adding more advanced machines, but we quickly discovered that insufficient production was just the tip of the iceberg. As players advanced technologically, they built a massive number of machines to meet their demands, leading to severe server lag issues.  Therefore, the mod's development direction gradually shifted towards optimizing performance and increasing the efficiency of individual machines to cope with the challenges of large-scale automated production in the late game

## Requirement

- GTLCore  `Version >= 1.1.1`

## Install

First,Download `GregTech Leisure` [here](https://www.123pan.com/s/LDeAjv-EHZ03.html),and install it with your Minecraft Launcher
