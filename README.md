| Super Input Dual Hatch  | Similar to `Huge Input Dual Hatch` , but with more input space             |

In addition, there are also some defiled Part

- `WirelessOpticalDataHatch` *and* `WirelessOpticalComputationHatch` allow Multiblock Machine **sharing**
- `AutoConfigurationMaintenanceHatch` series also allow Multiblock Machine **sharing** *And* There is a slot where different items can be stuffed to obtain different bonuses

### Recipe

- Many simplified recipes have been added, which can help optimize large-scale production lines. Please learn to use **`jei`** to find recipes. If this recipe is added by `GTLAdditions`, there will be a prompt to explain(So you can often look through jei in your daily life. You will always find some new recipes)
- The addition of brand-new SOC chips and wafers enables more efficient circuit production
